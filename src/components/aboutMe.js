          Hi there, Let's skip the name part, since you already know that. Iâ€™m
          an enthusiastic software developer specializing in web design and
          development, graphic design, mobile app development and also content
          development. Over the years I have found a new love for anything
          digital and making technology easy to use and accessible to everyone
          (feels good to do good right?).
          <span role="img" aria-label="happy">

          </span>{" "}
          I've worked and mastered libraries and frameworks like bootstrap and
          react respectively. Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work on some fantastic
          projects , one being the UNESCO YouthMobile project while working at
          the McAnderson Institute of Technology MIT. Also Alongside 19 bright
          developers, I was part of training 2000 NPower Tech beneficiaries on
          digital marketing and full stack software development using html, css,
          bootstrap, javascript, php, mysql and wordpress. However, when Iâ€™m not
          behind my pc, you could find me in a cocktail bar, chilling with
          friends. <br /> Feel free to <Link to="/contact">contact</Link> me.
